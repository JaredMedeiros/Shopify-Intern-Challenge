# Hi! I'm Jared Medeiros, and this is my react application for Shopify's front-end internship challenge.

You can find a live version of this application here - 

## About my application

This application, Response Bot, was built using React and SASS. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 Ai model. The user types in and submits a prompt for the Ai, or chooses a predefined prompt if they are unsure of where to start. This then makes a post request to the OpenAI API, and returns a response based upon the user's prompt. The user is able to view a list of responses, with the corresponding prompts, in a list from newest to oldest request.

## About me!

My name is Jared and I am a passionate, dedicated developer, eager for new opportunities, and hungry for growth. With a background predominatelty in design and e-commerce photo production, I made the decision this year to attend BrainStation's intensive Fullstack Web Developing bootcamp, after a long period of feeling unchallenged and disatisfied with my professional trajectory. In seeking creative stimulation and intellectual growth, I begin to explore the world of code, and found myself immeditaley wrapped up in curiosity and dedication.

I am looking for my foothold in tech as a career developer. I know without a doubt that my technical knowledge, capacity for learning, and unwaivering drive will cary me far if given the opportunity.
